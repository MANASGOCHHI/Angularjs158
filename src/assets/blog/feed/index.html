				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As CFOs face growing margin pressure, they look for options to cut costs. Because procurement team is in charge of reducing raw material prices and costs, and identifying better sources of supply, CFOs turn to procurement team to provide new source of cost optimization, ease the margin pressure and improve the &#8216;bottom line&#8217;.<br />
To meet growing expectation from shareholders, over the last few years procurement function has put a lot of attention to organizational development, more centralized way of working and standardization in procurement’s operating model. Therefore, more than ever, procurement teams need actionable insights from their data to improve performance in their day to day operations. Starting from analyze consumption patterns to options to move towards bundled purchase to purchasing more from preferred suppliers to creating effective category plans, procurement leadership team is looking for every options to reduce cost.<br />
While it sounds obvious, many companies have procurement teams who are still crunching several spread sheets or using intuition to forecast price and measure impact. Few companies have started analytics journey, but competing priorities, time required building analytics from scratch and lack of internal expertise slows their progress.<br />
If you haven’t started analytics journey, now is the time to start. If you have already started and looking for ways to expedite deployment, then you need to look for pre-packaged solutions that can expedite implementation and enable you quickly mature in your analytics capabilities. Strengthening procurement analytics capabilities would help you dramatically improve organizational performance, enable you to provide new opportunities for cost saving and enhance your ability to create strategic impact on your business.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Often organizations get into taking difficult decision of building the analytics internally from scratch or implementing pre-built analytic applications. Even if they finally decide to build analytics solutions internally, many organizations struggle to deliver compelling analytics solutions that provide useful insights and meet needs of business users. The truth is analytics solutions are hard to build from scratch. Business users need to imagine the usage and think through all scenarios without seeing anything (difficult), availability of internal resources with skills in data science with business acumen, data extract, transform and load (ETL) (challenging), rationalizing business requirement and creating compelling metrics (hard), designing intuitive dashboard (challenging).</p>
<p>Of the shelf analytic applications integrate all the components required to deliver value in quickest possible time. Pre-built analytics are cheaper and quicker to implement and easier to maintain. Pre-built solutions such as DecisionSigma contain industry best practices and techniques and have proven value in other organizations. DecisionSigma comes with plugins for major ERPs such as SAP and Oracle and an enterprise data model. This makes it even easier to integrate with existing internal systems and realize return on investment (ROI) quicker.</p>
<p>Most pre-built analytic packages are usually tailored to specific business functions, ranging from supply chain, sales, marketing to finance and human resources. With the option of either cloud or on premise implementation, DecisionSigma helps enterprises that have significant direct cost to –<br />
 Negotiate efficiently with suppliers using pre-built should cost model<br />
 Forecast raw material prices based on commodity &amp; feedstock price fluctuations<br />
 Analyze raw material price volatility and simulate profitability<br />
 Gain deep insights into Rate, Volume, Mix &amp; FX impact<br />
 Mitigate risk for top-raw materials tied to revenue</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Should cost model (“clean sheet model”), originally developed and adopted by the Department of Defense to determine fair prices of equipment they procure, started getting popularity among industry in early 90’s. Now should cost modelling is one of most dominant techniques used by companies that has high direct costs.<br />
Should-cost modeling requires organizations to think as if they are manufacturing the product that they are buying. This requires them to estimate materials cost, labor cost, overhead cost, and profit margin for unit quantity of the product they are procuring.<br />
Generally, engineering team within the organization comes up with list of materials used and they quantity, manufacturing team estimates the labor and then procurement team estimates approximate material cost and assign a reasonable profit margin to determine should cost. Sometimes companies work with external agencies to put together the estimated data for part of their material.<br />
Some organizations still think estimating the model is too complex and time consuming, But they fail to ignore that many times material cost constitutes major portion(sometimes >60%) of the cost and if they simply can estimate material cost then they covered 60% of the total cost. Companies can start with raw material cost and over the period of time, they can slowly build the full model on top of raw material cost.<br />
How to build should cost model?<br />
To build should cost model, organizations can use several tools such as excel or other analytical tools such as Decision Sigma. Many times we find excels are easy to use, but creating models using excel has many draw backs.<br />
First, when models are built using excel, many times only one or two persons in the company can understand those excels. Also each person builds the model in his own way. Therefore, organizations fail to implement best practices and share lessons learned among different people to optimize models. Also when the person who manages models developed using excel leaves company or moves different role within same company, it becomes difficult for the next person to understand those excel and continue leveraging those should cost models.<br />
Second, Models built using excels do not connect to any historical database nor it can integrate forecasted price of raw materials or sale volume that easily. Therefore, users fail to quantify historical missing opportunities or forecasted future opportunity. Sometimes users spend lot of time optimizing a should cost model for a particular raw material, but if that raw material is not forecasted to as high priority raw material then effort to optimize the models does not pay off. Lack of real time integration of the models with commodity price, historical purchase volume and forecasts sales volume contribute to wrong priorities and missed opportunities.<br />
Finally, excels are easy to lose. When we lose excels, all the hard work put into building the model goes waste and organizations lose valuable intellectual asset built over period of time.<br />
Analytic tools like DecisionSigma helps users build should cost models that connect to historical spend data, forecasted sales, bills of material and most importantly real time commodity market data. It allows entire depart to work on one system in more standardize manner, share best practice and develop multiple what-if should cost models.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many companies buy commodity forecast data from third party vendors. But commodities itself are not the direct raw materials that those companies purchase. Rather raw materials that companies purchase are made out of those commodities. So the prices of those raw materials depend on the price of multiple commodities and other econometric factors.<br />
The fluctuations in the global economic situation and other external factors have a direct impact on prices of raw materials, and their supply &#038; demand situation. Because commodity prices are volatile, companies that want to know how the price for any raw material would change over times need have a process to analyze the trends and see the impact.<br />
Knowing how global trends impacts the cost position allows management team to think how they can take steps create opportunity for cost reduction. A combination of historical spend analytics and future spend forecasts becomes useful tool to clearly measure the impact and adopt strategy that address long term business goals.<br />
Those companies who have the capability to clearly identify the relationship between raw materials and corresponding commodities are able to take the commodity forecast data to measure impact to cost structure. This enables organizations to take appropriate steps that stabilize firms’ cost structures and develop effective budgets. As a result, marketing and sales function gets enough time to prepare strategy for contract negotiation, optimize product portfolio and negotiate prices with customers while safeguarding profitability.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every day the world we live in is getting smaller and smaller. Countries are more connected than ever before. Globalization is not just a phenomenon, but it is the new norm and here to stay. While globalization has its own positive effect on human lives and businesses, it also creates new challenges. An unexpected event of natural calamities,financial crisis, global recession and even political instability often leads to catastrophic impact on businesses located even thousands of miles away. As a result, companies face increase in raw material prices, increase in labor cost or increase in overhead cost or other costs. </p>
<p>When prices of raw materials used for making industrial products (such as steel, copper and aluminum) and consumer packaged goods (such as corn, wheat and milk) go up, many companies lack the strategy and plan to quickly respond and address the issue. Therefore companies struggle to meet profitability and growth target. To sustain profit margin and meet shareholders ‘expectations, organizations need to plan ahead and have the necessary strategy and resources so that they can take appropriate<br />
action when they face situation.</p>
<p><strong>Missed Opportunity</strong> In today’s day in time, it is hard to imagine an organization that doesn’t leverage an ERP or CRM systems to run its business on daily basis.</p>
<p>We find most of the businesses use some sort of ERP system that may include SAP or Oracle or JDE or other ERPs or any home grown systems to process business transactions. However as businesses accumulate transaction data over time, they overlook the value of integrating ERP data with external market data and<br />
applying advanced analytics. As a result they miss the opportunity to draw many valuable insights and struggle to respond quickly. Therefore, they miss the opportunity to turn volatility in raw material prices into an advantage and stay ahead of the competition. </p>
