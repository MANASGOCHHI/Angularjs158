The truth is analytics solutions are hard to build from scratch.

<p>Of the shelf analytic applications integrate all the components required to deliver value in quickest possible time. Pre-built analytics are cheaper and quicker to implement and easier to maintain. Pre-built solutions such as DecisionSigma contain industry best practices and techniques and have proven value in other organizations. DecisionSigma comes with plugins for major ERPs such as SAP and Oracle and an enterprise data model. This makes it even easier to integrate with existing internal systems and realize return on investment (ROI) quicker.</p>
