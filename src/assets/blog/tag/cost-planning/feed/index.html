				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many companies buy commodity forecast data from third party vendors. But commodities itself are not the direct raw materials that those companies purchase. Rather raw materials that companies purchase are made out of those commodities. So the prices of those raw materials depend on the price of multiple commodities and other econometric factors.<br />
The fluctuations in the global economic situation and other external factors have a direct impact on prices of raw materials, and their supply &#038; demand situation. Because commodity prices are volatile, companies that want to know how the price for any raw material would change over times need have a process to analyze the trends and see the impact.<br />
Knowing how global trends impacts the cost position allows management team to think how they can take steps create opportunity for cost reduction. A combination of historical spend analytics and future spend forecasts becomes useful tool to clearly measure the impact and adopt strategy that address long term business goals.<br />
Those companies who have the capability to clearly identify the relationship between raw materials and corresponding commodities are able to take the commodity forecast data to measure impact to cost structure. This enables organizations to take appropriate steps that stabilize firmsâ€™ cost structures and develop effective budgets. As a result, marketing and sales function gets enough time to prepare strategy for contract negotiation, optimize product portfolio and negotiate prices with customers while safeguarding profitability.</p>
