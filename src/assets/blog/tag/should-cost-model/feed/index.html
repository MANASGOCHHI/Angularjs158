				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Should cost model (“clean sheet model”), originally developed and adopted by the Department of Defense to determine fair prices of equipment they procure, started getting popularity among industry in early 90’s. Now should cost modelling is one of most dominant techniques used by companies that has high direct costs.<br />
Should-cost modeling requires organizations to think as if they are manufacturing the product that they are buying. This requires them to estimate materials cost, labor cost, overhead cost, and profit margin for unit quantity of the product they are procuring.<br />
Generally, engineering team within the organization comes up with list of materials used and they quantity, manufacturing team estimates the labor and then procurement team estimates approximate material cost and assign a reasonable profit margin to determine should cost. Sometimes companies work with external agencies to put together the estimated data for part of their material.<br />
Some organizations still think estimating the model is too complex and time consuming, But they fail to ignore that many times material cost constitutes major portion(sometimes >60%) of the cost and if they simply can estimate material cost then they covered 60% of the total cost. Companies can start with raw material cost and over the period of time, they can slowly build the full model on top of raw material cost.<br />
How to build should cost model?<br />
To build should cost model, organizations can use several tools such as excel or other analytical tools such as Decision Sigma. Many times we find excels are easy to use, but creating models using excel has many draw backs.<br />
First, when models are built using excel, many times only one or two persons in the company can understand those excels. Also each person builds the model in his own way. Therefore, organizations fail to implement best practices and share lessons learned among different people to optimize models. Also when the person who manages models developed using excel leaves company or moves different role within same company, it becomes difficult for the next person to understand those excel and continue leveraging those should cost models.<br />
Second, Models built using excels do not connect to any historical database nor it can integrate forecasted price of raw materials or sale volume that easily. Therefore, users fail to quantify historical missing opportunities or forecasted future opportunity. Sometimes users spend lot of time optimizing a should cost model for a particular raw material, but if that raw material is not forecasted to as high priority raw material then effort to optimize the models does not pay off. Lack of real time integration of the models with commodity price, historical purchase volume and forecasts sales volume contribute to wrong priorities and missed opportunities.<br />
Finally, excels are easy to lose. When we lose excels, all the hard work put into building the model goes waste and organizations lose valuable intellectual asset built over period of time.<br />
Analytic tools like DecisionSigma helps users build should cost models that connect to historical spend data, forecasted sales, bills of material and most importantly real time commodity market data. It allows entire depart to work on one system in more standardize manner, share best practice and develop multiple what-if should cost models.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many companies buy commodity forecast data from third party vendors. But commodities itself are not the direct raw materials that those companies purchase. Rather raw materials that companies purchase are made out of those commodities. So the prices of those raw materials depend on the price of multiple commodities and other econometric factors.<br />
The fluctuations in the global economic situation and other external factors have a direct impact on prices of raw materials, and their supply &#038; demand situation. Because commodity prices are volatile, companies that want to know how the price for any raw material would change over times need have a process to analyze the trends and see the impact.<br />
Knowing how global trends impacts the cost position allows management team to think how they can take steps create opportunity for cost reduction. A combination of historical spend analytics and future spend forecasts becomes useful tool to clearly measure the impact and adopt strategy that address long term business goals.<br />
Those companies who have the capability to clearly identify the relationship between raw materials and corresponding commodities are able to take the commodity forecast data to measure impact to cost structure. This enables organizations to take appropriate steps that stabilize firms’ cost structures and develop effective budgets. As a result, marketing and sales function gets enough time to prepare strategy for contract negotiation, optimize product portfolio and negotiate prices with customers while safeguarding profitability.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every day the world we live in is getting smaller and smaller. Countries are more connected than ever before. Globalization is not just a phenomenon, but it is the new norm and here to stay. While globalization has its own positive effect on human lives and businesses, it also creates new challenges. An unexpected event of natural calamities,financial crisis, global recession and even political instability often leads to catastrophic impact on businesses located even thousands of miles away. As a result, companies face increase in raw material prices, increase in labor cost or increase in overhead cost or other costs. </p>
<p>When prices of raw materials used for making industrial products (such as steel, copper and aluminum) and consumer packaged goods (such as corn, wheat and milk) go up, many companies lack the strategy and plan to quickly respond and address the issue. Therefore companies struggle to meet profitability and growth target. To sustain profit margin and meet shareholders ‘expectations, organizations need to plan ahead and have the necessary strategy and resources so that they can take appropriate<br />
action when they face situation.</p>
<p><strong>Missed Opportunity</strong> In today’s day in time, it is hard to imagine an organization that doesn’t leverage an ERP or CRM systems to run its business on daily basis.</p>
<p>We find most of the businesses use some sort of ERP system that may include SAP or Oracle or JDE or other ERPs or any home grown systems to process business transactions. However as businesses accumulate transaction data over time, they overlook the value of integrating ERP data with external market data and<br />
applying advanced analytics. As a result they miss the opportunity to draw many valuable insights and struggle to respond quickly. Therefore, they miss the opportunity to turn volatility in raw material prices into an advantage and stay ahead of the competition. </p>
